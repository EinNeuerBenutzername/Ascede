# Ascede

Ascede is a C99 2D framework, forked from the awesome game framework: [raylib](https://www.raylib.com). You can take a look if you don't know it yet.

**This project is intended for my personal use, so it might not suit you.** Also, I'm not going to put a lot of effort into this project. In fact, I hope you can ignore this project. Of course, you can use it as you like, but it's unstable and I don't take any risk.

I love raylib, but sometimes I find certain designs of raylib unintuitive (e.g. time control in older versions like v3.7) or unnecessary (e.g. 3D support, screenshots and video recordings, which I don't actually need) in my development. 

What I'm doing here is basically cutting out some parts of raylib to enhance my personal development experience. My goal is to reduce functionality and even scalability in exchange for shorter development cycles and smaller binary sizes. **I strongly suggest you try raylib instead of using this library.** Raylib is more functional and is under constant development, whereas Ascede is less functional, more unstable and rarely updated.

There are other drawbacks of Ascede:

- I won't fix any bugs in Ascede that don't affect my own use, because this is a personal project. I won't bother with Issues, either.
- Ascede is 2D-only. It has no 3D support and most probably never will.
- Ascede's target platforms are desktop platforms, mainly Windows. It would rarely be tested on Linux and MacOS.
- If I find it uninteresting or unnecessary, I won't expand Ascede's platform support.
- I won't accept collaborations and pull requests because that would complicate my work.

If you find these flaws unacceptable, I hereby sincerely recommend you to use raylib. 

I apologize if you feel offended. Thank you very much for reading this article.
